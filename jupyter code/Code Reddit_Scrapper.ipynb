It’s always been easier to tell myself I just can’t do something than to give it a try. It’s why I sucked at sports, why I never picked up another language and why although my grades were good enough to get me into a decent university and eventually graduate, they probably weren’t as high as they could have been. No matter the topic I always think of the worst case scenario, from thinking a task at work or school is too difficult to simply thinking that the woman I like is out of my league. \n","\n","I’m actually trying to challenge my beliefs, having learned a new alphabet and looking on how to continue in said language and I’ve lost weight with the help of a coach - you can guess which sport I’d like to compete in one day. I want to learn how to persevere and take on challenges and there are people I look up to who I’d like to meet because of said goals. I need to try, as it’s often said that the comfort zone is where people often fail. The only problem is, I can’t stop seeing the people I aspire to as gods, in no small part because I’m a beginner at what I’m doing. Sure embarrassment is the cost of entry but as long as I’m a beginner, I worry I’ll just stay a loser and a boring individual in everyone else’s eyes.\n","\n","I want to stop putting my idols on a pedestal and start seeing them as people who’s level I actually can reach. My coach is proud of my progress and reminds me that the process takes time. It’s easy to feel like I don’t know what I’m doing when I don’t have a mentor present but I want to overcome that fear. This is something I want to take into every aspect of my life so I don’t have to keep beating myself up at every turn.\n","\n","P.S. Yes I’ve been to therapy, but while I did find it helpful, the best solution I got was to imagine whether or not I’d say the things I say to myself to someone else with the same problem. Of course the answer is no but for me, that’s a short term fix.\n","it seems like everytime i see a *single* bump on my face, i end up picking with it. and it's annoying, but i can't really stop myself. i have a similar problem with my hair too and i'm afraid one of my locs will fall out if i continue it.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!zip -r ./non_depression.zip
